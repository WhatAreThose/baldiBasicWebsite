Character: **The Test**

## Description
- **The Test's** head is a *strange, floating, bald* human-like CGI head with an extended neck ended with what appears to be a prism shape.
- Its facial features only sport small, pupil-less white eyeballs and an open red square-shaped mouth. This head mildly resembles the overall shape of a light bulb.
- **The Test's** body wears a sleeveless darker gray shirt and black pants. **The Test** also wears dark brown/yellow sleeves, flat white shoes, and white-gloved hands with four fingers.
